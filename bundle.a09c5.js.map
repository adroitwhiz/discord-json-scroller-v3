It aims\n * to be compliant with John Gruber's [Markdown Syntax page][1],\n * but compatiblity with other markdown implementations' edge-cases\n * will be sacrificed where it conflicts with simplicity or\n * extensibility.\n *\n * If your goal is to simply embed a standard markdown implementation\n * in your website, simple-markdown is probably not the best library\n * for you (although it should work). But if you have struggled to\n * customize an existing library to meet your needs, simple-markdown\n * might be able to help.\n *\n * Many of the regexes and original logic has been adapted from\n * the wonderful [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked)\n *\n * LICENSE (MIT):\n * New code copyright (c) 2014-2019 Khan Academy & Aria Buckles.\n *\n * Portions adapted from marked.js copyright (c) 2011-2014\n * Christopher Jeffrey (https://github.com/chjj/).\n *\n * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n * of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n * in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n * to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n * copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n * furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n *\n * The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n * all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n *\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n * IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n * FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For most\n    grammars most of the time we will never actually need anything more than the\n    first MultiRegex - so this shouldn't have too much overhead.\n\n    Say this is our search group, and we match regex3, but wish to ignore it.\n\n      regex1 | regex2 | regex3 | regex4 | regex5    ' ie, startAt = 0\n\n    What we need is a new MultiRegex that only includes the remaining\n    possibilities:\n\n      regex4 | regex5                               ' ie, startAt = 3\n\n    This class wraps all that complexity up in a simple API... `startAt` decides\n    where in the array of expressions to start doing the matching. It\n    auto-increments, so if a match is found at position 2, then startAt will be\n    set to 3.  If the end is reached startAt will return to 0.\n\n    MOST of the time the parser will be setting startAt manually to 0.\n  */\n  class ResumableMultiRegex {\n    constructor() {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.rules = [];\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.multiRegexes = [];\n      this.count = 0;\n\n      this.lastIndex = 0;\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    getMatcher(index) {\n      if (this.multiRegexes[index]) return this.multiRegexes[index];\n\n      const matcher = new MultiRegex();\n      this.rules.slice(index).forEach(([re, opts]) => matcher.addRule(re, opts));\n      matcher.compile();\n      this.multiRegexes[index] = matcher;\n      return matcher;\n    }\n\n    resumingScanAtSamePosition() {\n      return this.regexIndex !== 0;\n    }\n\n    considerAll() {\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    addRule(re, opts) {\n      this.rules.push([re, opts]);\n      if (opts.type === \"begin\") this.count++;\n    }\n\n    /** @param {string} s */\n    exec(s) {\n      const m = this.getMatcher(this.regexIndex);\n      m.lastIndex = this.lastIndex;\n      let result = m.exec(s);\n\n      // The following is because we have no easy way to say \"resume scanning at the\n      // existing position but also skip the current rule ONLY\".
