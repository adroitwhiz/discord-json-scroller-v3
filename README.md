## discord-json-scroller-v3

This is a web app that allows you to browse server archives created by my bots.

### Setup
To install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
To set up and start a local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Output will be served from [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

To build:
```bash
npm run build
```
Build output will be in `/build`.

To do:
- Allow archives to be saved to a URL and loaded from one
- Lazy-load images once they are scrolled to
